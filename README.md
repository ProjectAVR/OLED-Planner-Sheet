# OLED-Planner-Sheet
A gridded sheet to plan text/graphic layout on 32-64×128 OLEDs

Recently, I’ve been experimenting with the cheap 32×128 and 64×128 OLED Displays available from various emporiums. I’ve managed to prototype a simple Temp/Humidity/Pressure device without too much trouble, details will probably appear on ProjectAVR.com in due course.

One of the things that I found difficult was how to plan out the display elements. In the ‘old days’ of program planning, a lot of work was done on paper so I decided to design an OLED Display Planner Sheet enabling me to draw what I wanted and instantly find out what co-ordinates to use.

Each axis has the cell numbers on it and the lower 32 cells are shaded indicating the second set of 32 pixels. You can use the sheet for planning either two 128×32 sized OLEDs or one 128×64 sized OLED.
